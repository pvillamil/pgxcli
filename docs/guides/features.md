pgxcli is an interactive PostgreSQL REPL built in Go. This page highlights the core features that make it fast, readable, and comfortable to use.

## Syntax Highlighting

pgxcli applies real-time syntax highlighting to your SQL as you type, using [Chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma) — the same engine that powers many static site generators and code tools.

Colors are applied to keywords, identifiers, string literals, operators, and comments, so long queries remain easy to read at a glance.

pgxcli automatically detects your terminal's color depth — TrueColor, 256-color, or 16-color — and picks the right formatter for your environment.

## Autocompletion

pgxcli offers word-based completion for SQL keywords. Press `Tab` to cycle through suggestions.
