pgxcli gives you several ways to connect. Pick whichever fits your workflow.

## Positional Arguments

The quickest way. Pass the database name and (optionally) the username:

```bash
pgxcli mydb
pgxcli mydb myuser
```

If you skip the username, pgxcli uses the current OS user — or the `PGXUSER` / `PGUSER` environment variable if set.

## Connection Flags

For full control, use flags:

```bash
pgxcli --host localhost --port 5432 --user postgres --dbname mydb
```

Short forms work too:

```bash
pgxcli -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d mydb
```

You can mix flags and positional arguments. Flags take priority.

:::note
`--host` uses `-h` as its shorthand. The built-in `--help` flag has no shorthand — use `--help` to see usage.

## Connection URI

Pass a standard PostgreSQL connection string as the first argument:

```bash
pgxcli postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb
```

pgxcli detects `://` or `=` in the first argument and treats it as a connection string automatically. Any format that `libpq` accepts will work.

## Interactive Form

Launch a TUI form that lets you fill in connection details visually:

```bash
pgxcli -i
```

The form pre-fills values from any flags or positional arguments you passed. It validates input (like port range) as you type, and shows a live summary of the connection you're about to make.

You can also combine it with flags to set defaults:

```bash
pgxcli -i -h myhost -d mydb
```

## Password Handling

By default, pgxcli tries to connect without a password first. If the server rejects the attempt with an authentication error, it prompts you automatically.

You can control this:

| Flag | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `-W` / `--password` | Always prompt for password before connecting |
| `-w` / `--no-password` | Never prompt — use `PGXPASSWORD` or `PGPASSWORD` from the environment instead |

These two flags are mutually exclusive.

:::tip
In the interactive form (`-i`), there's a password field built in — so you don't need `-W`.

## Default User Resolution

When no username is provided, pgxcli resolves it in this order:

1. `PGXUSER` environment variable
2. `PGUSER` environment variable
3. Current OS username

## Switching Databases

Already connected? Switch to a different database without restarting:

```
\c other_db
```

pgxcli opens a new connection to `other_db` on the same server and closes the old one. See [Special Commands](/docs/guides/special-commands) for more.
